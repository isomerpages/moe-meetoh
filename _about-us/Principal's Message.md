<h3>PRINCIPAL'S MESSAGE</h3>
<p><strong>We love to our Children in our Mee Toh Family unconditionally</strong>
</p>
<p></p>
<p>2026 will be a lovely year for our children.</p>
<p></p>
<p>LOVE is the theme for the work we do in 2026. We will be strengthening
our character and citizenship education (CCE) by focusing on getting our
children to <strong><u>l</u></strong>ive <strong><u>o</u></strong>ut our
Mee Toh <strong><u>v</u></strong>alues <strong><u>e</u></strong>very day
(LOVE). We have also refined and reduced our Mee Toh values to the following: <em>Respect</em>, <em>Responsibility</em>, <em>Resilience</em>, <em>Integrity</em>, <em>Care</em> and <em>Harmony</em>.
We will be using these values to help our children internalise and demonstrate
them every day as they are being taught during the CCE lessons. For example,
we will kick start our structured “Clean Up Time!” routine where our children
will clean up their classrooms before the end of each school day. &nbsp;We
also want to thank our parents who had voted the following mascot in November
2025 to represent each of these values, and we will be using these mascots
to promote and celebrate these values and their observable behaviours in
our Mee Toh Family.</p>
<p>They are:</p>

<p>(Note: I would like to thank Ms Elaine Tan and Ms Sabrina Tay for making
these mascots come alive.)</p>
<p>I would like to end with a short story. It was about a wealthy man who
had many children, and they lived in a big house. One day, the house caught
fire, and his children were distracted with the games and toys that they
were playing and were unaware that the house was on fire. The desperate
man came back and shouted out at his children with the promise of a cart
load of new toys and games. Excitedly, his children rushed out of the house,
thinking about the new games and toys that they could play with. To their
dismay, there were none. The wealthy man was very grateful that his children
were safe and well.</p>
<p>You must be wondering the purpose of sharing this story. It was about
the love of a parent for his children, and his quick minded response had
helped to save his children.</p>
<p>Likewise, Mee Toh School was founded by Venerable Sek Kong Hiap in 1954
with the hope to educate the young children in the neighbourhood who could
otherwise be roaming in the streets without a proper education. His love
for all children was unconditional, and his dream and actions offered hope
and character formation for these children.</p>
<p>We will continue with Venerable Sek Kong Hiap’s noble and selfless legacy.
Like the wealthy man, every member of our Mee Toh Family strives to offer
hope and love to every child unconditionally and to grow her or him to
become a person of character, who is a good and useful citizen for Singapore
and tomorrow.</p>
<p>May I use this opportunity to thank in advance every stakeholder and parent
for your generous support and to invite you to journey with us to bring
out the best in every child in our Mee Toh Family. May you and your loved
ones be blessed with good health and happiness always.</p>
<p></p>
<p>To partner with you,
<br>Kelvin Tay
<br>Principal</p>
