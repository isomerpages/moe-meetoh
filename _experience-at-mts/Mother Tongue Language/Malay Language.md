#### HIGHLIGHTS

##### Mother Tongue Language Fortnight (MTLF)

MTLF aims to create an immersive environment for learning and appreciating Mother Tongue languages and Culture. During this annual event, students are engaged in fun and meaningful activities to deepen their love and appreciation of their roots. They experience their respective Mother Tongue Language as a ‘living language’ through activities such as learning to play traditional games and writing ‘khat’. They also have a chance to showcase their oracy skills through intra-level competitions.  

##### 'Baca Ria' (Extensive Reading Programme)

To instill the love for reading from a young age, our students are exposed to different reading materials. Supplementary activities are conducted to reinforce students' understanding of their reading. At the lower primary, students visit the library weekly to promote good reading habits and library etiquette. Students also share their current or favourite reads with their classmates. 

##### Pick and Tell

Students are taught different components which constitute good public speaking. During the Pick and Tell session, students present their content and thoughts based on thematic cards. This activity challenges the students’ thinking to a higher level, enhancing their ability to respond quickly and raise their confidence in speaking.

##### Reader’s Theatre

To develop reading fluency, students read scripts aloud with expression. Students do not need to memorise their parts but need only to reread several times. The repeated collaborative reading increases their comprehension of the text. Costumes and props are included to enhance their performance. This strategy increases reading motivation and builds students’ self-confidence.
