<p><strong>Physical Education (PE)</strong>
</p>
<p></p>
<p>Physical Education is an integral component of Singapore’s school curriculum
to develop students holistically. By emphasising the importance of movement,
and an individual’s interaction with the environment, Physical Education
seeks to develop the whole child to bring about a nation of physically
competent and confident individuals who enjoy a lifetime of active and
healthy living safely and responsibly.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The three learning areas of Physical Activity, Outdoor Education, and
Physical Health and Safety are pivotal in providing the content for design
and enactment of students’ meaningful learning experiences in, about and
through movement. These areas leverage the physical and social environment
to provide real-life contexts that strengthen students’ learning. A balanced
and well-designed Physical Education curriculum, delivered through effective
pedagogies and purposeful assessment can enable students to apply the skills,
knowledge, practices and values to lead an active and healthy lifestyle.
Additionally, it can help them acquire the 21st century competencies to
thrive in the fast changing and complex world.</p>
