**Strategies to Ensure Attention to Individual Pupil Development (SEAIP)**

Form Teachers play a central role in shaping the development of their young charges, and it is important for them to devote sufficient attention to their students' development. ‘Strategies to Ensure More Attention to Individual Pupil Development throughout Primary School Life’ (SEAIP), is intended to enable schools to strengthen the provision of pastoral care by creating strong and positive teacher-student relationships.

In Mee Toh School, we believe that every child is a unique individual. To know our students better, we have face-to-face interaction with students regularly on either a group or one-to-one basis. Through in-depth knowledge of every student, we are able to identify students’ needs, nurture their character traits, dispositions and attitudes, support them in their learning and development, and guide them to make appropriate decisions.
