<h4>HIGHLIGHTS</h4>
<h5>Language Acquisition Emphasis</h5>
<p>The school places much emphasis on the development of critical thinking
skill, oracy presentation as well as writing skills to equip our students
to be confident and effective communicator. Different pedagogies and age-appropriate
learning packages are designed to engage students in the learning of Chinese
Language.</p>
<h5>Love For Reading</h5>
<p>Instilling the love of reading is an integral part of Chinese Language
Learning. Our signature reading programmes (READ@MTL and “Dances with Books”
(与书共舞)) are conducted from Primary 1 to Primary 6, and students at different
levels are assigned and guided to read selected storybooks. The school
has also embarked on digital reading to facilitate ease of reading and
to encourage students to use screen time effectively.</p>
