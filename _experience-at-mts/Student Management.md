| **Goal<br>** 	| To enable students to successfully develop to their fullest potential by providing appropriate level of support (academic, behavioural and social-emotional) needed for Mee Toh to be an effective learning environment 	|

In our effort to develop our students holistically, we provide support for students with mild to moderate Special Educational Needs. While our Allied Educators School Counsellors provide support to students’ mental well-being and social-emotional development, our Allied Educators Learning & Behavioural Support support students with learning needs such as Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) and Dyslexia. Together with our Allied Educators Teaching & Learning, they work with teachers to nurture and improve students’ self-confidence, self-esteem and sense of independence. They also provide individual or small group skills training and intervention. Along with the members of our Case Management Team, which comprises the key members of the Student Development and Management committee, the progress of these students are monitored and the effectiveness of the intervention being evaluated regularly.
