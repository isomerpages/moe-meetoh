### Environmental Education


Environmental education is an important component of a holistic education and it goes beyond the textbooks. A whole-school approach is adopted towards environmental care through the schoolâ€™s Applied Learning Programme (ALP). The care for the environment is in line with the school motto, Compassion, where Mee Tohians practise the love for the environment and contribute to the environmental well-being for the community and nation. This is aligned to the national policy of working towards a liveable and sustainable city.

Environmental education encourages outdoor exploration, participate in active weekly recycling, Interdisciplinary Project work and Values-in-Action (IPW-VIA), environmental events and engage in community gardening projects. These activities not only enhance their understanding of environmental stewardship but also promote teamwork and social responsibility. Mee Tohians learn that they can make a difference, whether it is by recycling, conserving water, reducing plastic use and outreach to the community.
