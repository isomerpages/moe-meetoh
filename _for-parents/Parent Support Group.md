<h3>Parent Support Group (PATH)</h3><table><tbody><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p><strong>Purpose</strong><br>&nbsp;</p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>Partner and support the school’s long-term goals as well as initiatives, programmes and events that cater to the various needs of students and parents of Mee Toh School.</p></td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p><strong>Roles &amp; Responsibilities</strong><br>&nbsp;</p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>•Supportive Partner in Education</p><p>•Bridge Between Parents and School</p><p>•Magnet to Attract Other Parents</p></td></tr></tbody></table><p>Mee Toh School's parent support group, Parents As Teacher Helpers (PATH), was formed in 2006. Since then, our PATH has grown from strength to strength with more than 300 current members. Our PATH members work with the school to support various programmes and initiatives, such as Active Play, Weekly Recycling Programme, commemorative events (e.g., Laba Festival, Total Defence Day), and learning journeys to enhance and deepen the holistic education of Mee Tohians. PATH members also interact and connect with one another through parent-child bonding activities or events meant solely for parents' participation.</p><p>It takes a whole village to raise a child. PATH serves as a vital link between the school and teachers, the parents and the community. As PATH works closely with teachers and lend their support to school programmes and initiatives, PATH members have first-hand experience of the school’s direction, programmes and curriculum that their children undergo in Mee Toh School. They are thus able to provide valuable feedback on key areas, such as administration and programmes, to enrich the students' learning experiences.</p><p>PATH's ethos is in line with Aristotle’s belief that, "Educating the mind without educating the heart is no education at all". Action speaks louder than words, and no textbook can replace the heart, time and resources that our PATH members have dedicated in service to the school. PATH members are living and role-modelling our school’s core values through their acts of contribution to our Mee Tohians. They are an inspiration to our Mee Tohians, whom we hope they will likewise grow up embracing our school values and contribute meaningfully to society.</p><p><strong>PATH EXCO</strong></p><table><tbody><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p><strong>Name</strong></p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p><strong>Designation</strong></p></td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>Mr Loo Bee Seng</p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>Advisor</p></td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>Mdm Ang Yen Leng</p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>Chairman</p></td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>Mdm Maggie Lim</p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>Vice-Chairman</p></td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>Mdm Claire Li</p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>Vice-Chairman</p></td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>&nbsp;Mdm Yvonne Ng Gek Puey</p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>Secretary</p></td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>Mdm Nicole Tan</p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>Vice-Secretary</p></td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>Mdm Velary Koh</p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>Treasurer</p></td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>Mdm Chong Yi Mei</p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>Vice-Treasurer</p></td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>Mdm Catherine Low</p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>Mentor</p></td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>Mdm Cindy Tan</p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>Mentor</p></td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>Mdm Helen Ho</p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>Member</p></td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>Mdm Mandy Pang</p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>Member</p></td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>Mr Soh Jian Da</p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>Member</p></td></tr></tbody></table><p></p><p></p><p>If you would like to join the PATH, please click on the link&nbsp;<a href="https://tinyurl.com/2p829rw3" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">https://tinyurl.com/2p829rw3</a>.
