### Dharma Camp and Class

#### 佛学营

佛光山是我校的长期教育伙伴。早在2008年开始，我校已和佛光山携手合作，在每年的三月假期举办佛学营，旨在让学生将佛法落实在生活中，培养良好的品格。  

在为期两天的佛学营中，同学们可以透过多姿多彩的户外活动，亲身体验大自然与人类的密切关系，从而懂得惜福、感恩、尊重生命和学习爱护自己。除此之外，学生也会通过不同的文化活动，如种植盆栽，陶瓷制作培养耐性和发挥创意与艺术才华。

#### DHARMA CAMP

Our school and Fo Guang Shan Temple (Singapore) are long-term education partners. As early as 2008, the school has worked closely with FGS to organise an Annual Dharma Camp during the March holiday.

The camp aims to impart Dharma teachings and cultivate good character in Mee Tohians.  

During the two -day Dharma camp, students will have chance to be close to the nature. They will learn how to cherish, show gratitude and respect for life. Through the activities, students will develop patience, creativity and artistic talent.

#### 佛学班

新加坡佛光山在本校开办的“儿童佛学班”与“家长佛学班”于每年第一学段的第二周正式开课。感谢新加坡佛光山的有灯师父和义工老师们无私付出，教导学生及家长们学习佛法。    

开办儿童佛学班的目的是希望学生在接触佛学教义和薰习佛法后，能培养正确的价值观，以及向上、向善的积极生活态度，让学生在每日的处事待人中， 都能自然地表现出佛法的智慧。如：孝悌父母，感恩惜福一切所拥有的事物。家长也能参与家长佛学班，和孩子一同学习。

今年，新加坡佛光山监寺妙穆法师和吴宝德校长一起主持了学生授证及授书仪式。授证代表学生学习佛法的心灵印证，而授书则代表着佛法的延续。

#### DHARMA CLASS

The Dharma Class was officially launched on the 19 January 2008. This is the seventh year that the class is being conducted for the pupils and their parents. This class is conducted on Saturdays by Venerable You Deng, together with some volunteers from Fo Guang Shan Temple (Singapore).  

The objectives of this Dharma Class are to:  

\-    cultivate the correct and desired moral values in our pupils; <br>
\-    instil filial piety towards parents; and <br>
\-    be grateful for what they have.

Through these Dharma Teachings, our students will have the right perspectives of life and be more positive and compassionate towards others.

This year, Singapore Fo Guang Shan abbot Master Miao Mu and Mr Gau Poh Teck presented a Buddhist book to every student during Dharma Class Opening Ceremony.

#### Examniation Blessing 

##### 考试祈福典礼

新加坡佛光山在年终考试前夕会为我们的学生进行考试祈福典礼。考试祈福典礼不仅给予学生们精神上的鼓励，也教导学生如何面对压力和克服困难，努力读书以取得好成绩。典礼过后，师父还会给学生们说一些激励他们向上的故事。最后，师父还为师生们进行净化心灵的洒净仪式。

##### Examination Blessing Ceremony

The Examination Blessing Ceremony is held annually with the support of Fo Guang Shan Temple (Singapore). The ceremony is one of the ways of providing support for the pupils, who will be taking their year-end examinations soon. This ceremony conveys the understanding that examination is part and parcel of life. The pupils understand that perseverance is necessary to achieve good results and are also taught the importance of humility if they have done very well as well as resilience to cotninue to work hard if they do not perform well.

At the end of the ceremony, the Venerable tells stories to encourage the pupils to study conscientiously to maximise their potential.
