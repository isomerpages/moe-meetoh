<p><strong>Mathematics</strong>
</p>
<p>In Mee Toh School, we aim to foster Mathematical Thinking in our students
through fun and interesting activities. Mathematical thinking starts from
young. Our Primary one students celebrate their 100<sup>th</sup> Day in
Mee Toh School in July through a series of fun Mathematical activities
beyond the classrooms.</p>
<p></p>
<p>As they progress to other levels, we also design other activities to cultivate
a mindset that embraces problem-solving, critical thinking, metacoginition
and a deep understanding of mathematical concepts. One of them is the <strong>MTS Maths Week</strong> which
coincides with the International Day of Mathematics on 14 March (previously
known as pi day (3.14). During Math Week, we<strong> </strong>celebrate
how Mathematics has made our world and lives better through exciting activities
with our friends and families.</p>
