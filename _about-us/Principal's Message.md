<h3>PRINCIPAL'S MESSAGE</h3>
<p><strong>To offer Hope and Love to all our Mee Tohians unconditionally</strong></p>
<p>I would like to start a short story. It was about a wealthy man who had many children, and they live in a big house. One day, the house caught fire, and his children were distracted with the games and toys that they were playing and were unaware that the house was on fire. The desperate man came back and shouted out at his children with the promise of a cart load of new toys and games. Excitedly, his children rushed out of the house, thinking about the new games and toys that they could play with. To their dismay, there were none. The wealthy man was very grateful that his children were safe and well.</p>
<p>You must be wondering the purpose of sharing this story. It is about the love of a parent for his children and his quick minded response had helped to save his children. Likewise, Mee Toh School was founded by Venerable Sek Kong Hiap in 1954 with the hope to educate the young children in the neighbourhood who could otherwise be roaming in the streets without a proper education. His love for all children was unconditional, and his dream and actions offered hope and character formation for these children.</p>
<p>This noble vision is part of the SG60 narrative as we celebrate Singapore’s 60<sup>th</sup> birthday in 2025. Mee Toh School, today, will continue with Venerable Sek Kong Hiap’s noble and selfless legacy. Like the wealthy man, every member of the Mee Toh Family strives to offer hope and love to every Mee Tohian unconditionally and to grow them to become persons of character, who are good and useful citizens of tomorrow.</p>
<p>May I use this opportunity to thank every stakeholder and parent for your generous support and to invite you to journey with us to bring out the best in every Mee Tohian.&nbsp;</p>
<p>May you and your loved ones be blessed with good health and happiness always.</p>
<p>To serve with you,<br> Kelvin Tay<br> Principal</p>
