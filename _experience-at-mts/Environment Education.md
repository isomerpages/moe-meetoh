 Environment education is an important component of a holistic education. A whole-school approach is adopted towards environment care through the schoolâ€™s Applied Learning Programme (ALP). The care for the environment is in line with the school motto, Compassion, where MeeTohians practise the love and contribute to the environmental well-being for the environment in the community and nation. This is aligned to the national policy of working towards a liveable and sustainable city.
