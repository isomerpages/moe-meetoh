Mee Toh Schoolâ€™s IPW-VIA uses the Design Thinking Framework to allow students to synthesize their knowledge learnt from various subjects and apply them to solve real-world problems. This multi-faceted learning approach supports the holistic development of Mee Tohians. Our school values of service, teamwork, care and resilience are emphasised, reminding students of their responsibilities to the school, the environment and the community they live in.
