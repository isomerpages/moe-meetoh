<p><strong>English Language Learning in Mee Toh School</strong>
</p>
<p>In Mee Toh School, we envision our students to be effective and confident
communicators with the world. We aim to build a strong foundation in our
students’ listening, reading, viewing, speaking, writing and representing
skills, with essential grammar and vocabulary knowledge, in English Language.
Through our integrated and engaging approaches to teaching and learning,
we grow self-directed students who desire to learn throughout their lives
by reading for a variety of purposes, producing original and creative ideas,
and sharing them accurately and confidently with others in English Language.</p>

<h4>HIGHLIGHTS</h4>
<p><strong>EL Alive!</strong>
</p>
<p>The array of English Language (EL) activities engage students in both
the receptive skills of listening, reading and viewing, and productive
skills of speaking, writing and viewing. The differentiated and fun activities
raise the students’ awareness of the importance of using Standard English
Language for effective communication and interest them in the production
of accurate EL in speaking and writing tasks, such as poetry recitation,
script writing and drama performance. &nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>READS@MTS</strong>
</p>
<p>READS@MTS aims to build a culture of reading excellence in the school
through these reading programmes to promote reading habit among our students.
Students read regularly, critically and extensively for knowledge and pleasure.</p>
<p><strong>Reading with A Buddy</strong>
</p>
<p>Buddy Reading Programme caters to the reading needs of budding readers
in the lower primary levels. Students read age-appropriate and interesting
books with the help of Buddy Readers or iRead Pens as they gain confidence
and independence in reading.</p>
<p><strong>Exposure to Current Affairs</strong>
</p>
<p>Students read current affairs in What’s Up newspapers and put on their
critical lenses when responding to current issues with informed and responsible
personal opinion.</p>
<p><strong>Appreciating Literature</strong>
</p>
<p>Charlotte’s Web and Fantastic Mr Fox are some of the children classic
books students read for entertainment and comprehension. They make critical
judgement of the characters and plots and analyse language features of
the literary work to understand the writers’ styles and points of view.</p>
<p><strong>Drop Everything And Read</strong>
</p>
<p>Regular reading is emphasised in the Strategies for English Language Learning
and Reading (STELLAR) 2.0 curriculum. Reading time is structured in the
daily lessons to engage students in independent and silent reading. Students
bring the books they like to read or they can choose books from the collection
in the class and school library.</p>
<p><strong>Step Into Reading</strong>
</p>
<p>Step Into Reading programme comes with a collection of fiction and non-fiction
books suitable for young readers to read for pleasure and information respectively.
Pre or post reading activities have been designed for each title to set
clear purposes for reading and to involve students in creative thinking
about the book.</p>
<p><strong>IPW-VIA</strong>
</p>
<p>Integrated Project Work and Values in Action (IPW-VIA) is multi-faceted
and supports the growth of the whole child. As students work on school
and community projects in teams, they learn to collect information and
communicate in EL with clarity, empathy and discernment, while demonstrating
school values such as teamwork, resilience, service and care.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<strong>SEED</strong>
</p>
<p>Strategies for Engaged and Effective Development (SEED) curriculum creates
joy in interdisciplinary learning across subjects. Through experiential
learning, students apply and demonstrate their knowledge and skills acquired
in the various subjects, and their learning is augmented in authentic tasks
that require them to create crafts, write about their experiences and present
their research findings in EL.</p>
