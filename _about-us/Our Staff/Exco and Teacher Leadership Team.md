<br>[**Mr Poh Tsai Fu Bryan (Mr Bryan Poh)**](mailto:poh_tsai_fu_bryan@moe.edu.sg)<br>**Assistant Year Head - Primary 3**<br><br>Children learn best when their social and emotional needs are well taken care of. As educators, we help our children to recognise their strengths and develop good character so that they become confident yet caring individuals. Every child has a gift. Each just opens them at different times. |
[**Mdm Hasni Bte Abu Bakar**](mailto:hasni_abu_bakar@moe.edu.sg)<br>**Year Head - Primary 3 &amp; 4**<br><br><br>Children learn best when their social and emotional needs are well taken care of. As educators, we help our children to recognise their strengths and develop good character so that they become confident yet caring individuals. Every child has a gift.

Together, we can build a more compassionate and cohesive society by raising our next generation to be resilient, appreciative and selfless. |
 [**Mrs Jacelyn Ang**](mailto:sim_kun_kin@moe.edu.sg)<br>**Head of Department - School Staff Developer (SSD)**<br><br>An educated man is someone who displays culture, taste and knowledge. So, the true essence of education goes beyond acquiring of knowledge in an institute. As the saying goes, it takes a village to educate a woman, educating a child will require collaboration, between home and school for every child to grow into an educated adult. |

 [**Ms Neo Li Ting**](mailto:neo_li_ting@moe.edu.sg)<br>**Senior Teacher - Chinese Language**<br><br>《论语·为政》——子曰：“学而不思则罔，思而不学则殆”。 一味的读书，而不思考，只会受到书本表象的迷惑而不得甚解。而只是一味的埋头苦思而不进行一定的书本知识的积累，进而对知识进行研究推敲，也只能是流于空想，问题仍然不会得到解决，也就会产生更多的疑惑。只有把学习和思考结合起来，才能学以致用。 |

 [**Ms Yeo Li Choo (Ms Rachel Yeo)**](mailto:yeo_li_choo@moe.edu.sg)<br>**Level Head - Mathematics**<br><br>Education is not just about the teaching of skills and knowledge, it is also about inculcating good moral values and developing every child holistically.
