<p>In Mee Toh School, Character and Citizenship Education (CCE) is at the
heart of every school programme, academic and non-academic. CCE takes place
all the time in school, firmly anchored on MOE’s core values and guided
by the school vision, mission and motto - Compassion, Conscience, Purity
&amp; Righteousness.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We aim to develop in our students:</p>
<p>a.&nbsp;Good character: Have a sound moral compass and a strong sense
of right and wrong, think critically and ethically, be discerning in judgment,
take responsibility for choices and actions, be caring towards others and
strive for excellence;</p>
<p>b.&nbsp;Resilience and social-emotional well-being: Have a balanced sense
of self, form healthy relationships, be resilient when faced with challenges,
find meaning in life, and have a sense of gratitude and appreciation;</p>
<p>c.&nbsp;Future readiness: Have a sense of purpose in life, develop the
dispositions of adaptability and lifelong learning&nbsp;so as to&nbsp;be
able to navigate education and career pathways purposefully and take on
the challenges of the future, including the world of work and life; and</p>
<p>d.&nbsp;Active citizenship: Develop a strong national identity based on
a sense of belonging to the nation, a sense of hope in themselves and the
future, an awareness of the reality of Singapore’s vulnerabilities and
constraints, and the will to act on improving the lives of&nbsp;others,
and&nbsp;building a future for our nation.</p>
<h4>HIGHLIGHTS</h4>
<p>At Mee Toh School, we believe that the process of developing one’s character
is similar to the process of germination of the seed and cultivation of
the plant. Every child is unique; it requires time, patience, and a community
to nurture the whole child and bring out the best in every child.</p>
<h5>Form Teachers’ Guidance Period (FTGP)</h5>
<p>FTGP lessons uses authentic contexts in the explicit teaching and learning
of fundamental social-emotional skills which are anchored on values and
citizenship dispositions. Topics related to the six CCE content areas (i.e.,
Cyber Wellness, Education and Career Guidance, Family Education, Mental
Health, National Education, and Sexuality Education) are discussed in a
developmentally appropriate manner during the lessons. The lessons help
strengthen positive Teacher-Student Relationships (TSR) and build supportive
peer relationships. Time is also factored in for Form Teachers to have
individual conversations with students.&nbsp;</p>
<h5>CIVICS &amp; MORAL EDUCATION (CCE-MTL)</h5>
<p>CCE-MTL lessons focuses on the explicit teaching of R3ICH values within
the broader CCE framework. We believe that every Mee Tohian can be moulded
through a nurturing environment and school programmes tailored to the needs
of students. We provide opportunities for them to practice the values,
allow them to recognise the virtues, significance, or magnitude of people
and things around them, to help them understand how to strengthen relationships
and create an affirmative culture through various activities conducted
throughout the year. Through their active participation, Mee Tohians have
positively shown an inclination towards achieving the Desired Outcomes
of Education: Confident person, Self-directed Learner, Active Contributor
and Concerned Citizen.</p>
<h5>National Education (NE) and Social Studies (SS)</h5>
<p>National Education forms a part of the school’s citizenship programme.
Students have the opportunities to experience the Singapore story to foster
in them our national identity and the spirit of togetherness with one another.
Mee Tohians commemorate four core NE events as listed below. The Primary
SS syllabus helps students to grow in knowledge, develop skills and learn
values through examining issues that are of significance to our society
and the world in which we live.</p>

<h5>Learning Journeys</h5>
<p>Students embark on different field-based learning journeys every year
which will provide opportunities for them to acquire knowledge, understand
the significance of heritage places or places of interest beyond the classrooms,
and become well-informed and caring citizens. Mee Tohians learn in authentic
settings, gain hands-on experiences and discover the insights and stories
narrated in their textbooks.</p>
