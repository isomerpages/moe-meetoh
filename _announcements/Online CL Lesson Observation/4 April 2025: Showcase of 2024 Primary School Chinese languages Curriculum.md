<p>Channel 8 reported on MOE's Chinese Language (CL) Open Classroom Session
where primary CL teachers could tune in to the live-stream and learn how
they can nurture students' interest in learning CL through activities such
as "Spot the Difference", gamefication and animation resources.</p>
<p>Report carried CL teacher Mdm Zhang Yinan's soundbite that parents' feedback
towards such teaching method was positive and that it encourages their
children to speak CL more regularly at home. A student also shared that
her favourite part of the lesson was the small character cards (字宝宝) which
make learning Chinese characters fun.</p>
