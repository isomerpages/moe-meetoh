| Vision  	| Appreciate the beauty of Mathematics; Enjoy the process of Problem-Solving 	|
| Mission 	| To foster Mee Tohian's interest in Mathematics and develop their ability in mathematical problem-solving. 	|

#### Goals

At the end of their primary education in Mee Toh School, all Mee Tohians will be able to

*   acquire and apply mathematical concepts and skills;
*   develop thinking, reasoning, communication, application and metacognitive skills;
*   develop positive attitudes towards Mathematics

thus laying a strong foundation in mathematical problem-solving.

#### HIGHLIGHTS

##### Activity Based Lessons (ABL)

Students have fun with Mathematics through activity-based learning that engage them in 'learning by doing' and help them to develop conceptual understanding through the Concrete-Pictorial-Abstract approach.  

##### MTS Maths Week and P1 100th Day of School

In line with the International Day of Mathematics on 14 March (previously known as pi day (3.14), we have our very own MTS Maths Week to celebrate how mathematics has made our world and our lives better. Our P1 students also celebrate their 100th Day in Mee Toh School in July, which is a key milestone of their primary school education.

##### Mathematical Olympiad Programme

This programme is specifically catered for Primary 3 to Primary 6 students who display a strong interest in mathematics. It extends the studentsâ€™ learning by going beyond the primary school syllabus to expose them to higher order thinking skills, concepts and problem-solving strategies.

  

##### Math E2K Programme

This programme is catered to selected Primary 4 and Primary 5 students who demonstrate strong interest and ability in mathematics. Stories, games and puzzles are often used within the programme to engage the learners in problem solving.  

##### Learning Support for Mathematics (LSM) Programme

This programme is an early intervention programme for Primary 1 and Primary 2 students who need additional support to acquire basic knowledge and skills in numeracy. Lessons are conducted in small-sized groups so that teachers can provide more customised lessons for the students.  

  

##### Problem-Solving Package

This progressive learning package is designed to equip our students with a wider repertoire of problem-solving and thinking skills that are essential to tackle a variety of problems, including open-ended and real-world problems.

  

##### Partnering Parents

Parents are important partners in the learning of the students. The department shares insights into the learning of mathematics with our parents through school-organised workshops to deepen the understanding of how children learn mathematics.
