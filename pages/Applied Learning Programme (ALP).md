### Applied Learning Programme (ALP)

Mee Toh School adapts a whole-school approach towards environmental sustainability through our Applied Learning Programme in Environment Education. Every Mee Tohian is equipped with the values, knowledge and skills to care for the environment as part of character building. Opportunities are crated to enable students to make meaningful connections of what they have learnt about environmental issues with daily experiences.
