### Co-Curricular Activities (CCA)
Co-curricular Activities (CCAs) are an integral part of the holistic, well-rounded education that will enrich the learning experiences of our students. In Mee Toh School, our CCA programme is designed to cater to the interests and abilities of our students, guided by our schoolâ€™s core values - Care, Teamwork, Resilience, Excellence, Confidence, Integrity, Respect and Service. We believe that through sustained and active participation in CCAs, our students are able to develop social emotional competencies and 21st Century Skills that will prepare them for a rapid changing world. Hence the CCA department places great emphasis in fostering camaraderie, developing individual potential in sports, clubs, performing arts and uniformed group, instilling a life-long passion for the activity, inculcating leadership qualities, sportsmanship as well as developing robust character with a sound body and a disciplined mind.


#### Co-Curricular Activities (CCA) Guidelines

1.	Primary 2 students will be given the opportunity at the end of the school term (Term 4) to select their CCA for P3. Parents and child will be invited to attend the CCA Awareness Day in school where the various CCAs share more on their experiences and objectives. Some CCAs offer hands-on activities to let students have a try. Thereafter, students can select up to 6 choices through the CCA Selection Exercise. The students will then be informed of their allocated CCA from Primary 3 onwards through the Parents Gateway and/or CCA Teachers-in-Charge.

2.	All Primary 3 to Primary 6 students are involved in only one CCA. Students are strongly encouraged to stay with the CCA of his/her choice from Primary 3 to Primary 6. 

3.	Attendance at every CCA session is compulsory. Students must inform the CCA teacher-in-charge if they are unable to attend in advance. A medical certificate or letter from the parent/guardian must also be given to the CCA teacher-in-charge when the student returns to school, explaining his/her absence. Parents could also notify the school through the General Office in cases of emergencies.

4.	Parents are required to submit a written request to their respective current CCA teacher-in-charge if they would like to change the CCA for the students. All requests should also be supported with valid documentation. For instance, a medical condition must be supported by a valid medical report. The Head of Department of Physical Education & CCA, Subject Head Aesthetics and/or CCA Coordinator will evaluate each request on a case-by-case basis.
