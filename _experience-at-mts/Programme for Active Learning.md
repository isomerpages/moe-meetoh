At Mee Toh School, all Primary 1 and 2 students undergo Programme for Active Learning (PAL) modules as part of the holistic education during the curriculum time. PAL provides students exposure to two broad areas, Sports & Games and Outdoor Education, and the Performing Arts and Visual Arts. PAL offers learning experience that are active, hands on and meaningful. PAL also encompasses learning in a creative way, provides opportunities for students to create, incorporate values and social-emotional learning, fun and enjoyable.

With the modules spread over 2 years, we want to nurture in students the desire to learn, stay engaged as they enjoy learning, and develop competence with a sense of confidence. Through PAL, we want to see the students

*   learn and express themselves clearly,
*   develop positive habits and routines,
*   develop a keen sense of curiosity,
*   develop greater awareness of self and others,
*   learn to work in teams and
*   learn to make responsible decisions.
