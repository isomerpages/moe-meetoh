<h4>A Glimpse into the Past........</h4>
<p>In the 1950s, the need for a school to provide education for the population
of children living in attap houses in the area surrounding Leong San See
Temple led to the opening of Leong San School. Within a few months, the
classes were overcrowded. There was an apparent need for more classrooms.</p>
<p>The site adjacent to Leong San See Temple along Race Course Road, which
was initially designed for the construction of another temple, Mee Toh
Temple, was proposed for the expansion of Leong San School. In July of
1953, our Founder Venerable Kong Hiap wrote to Ministry of Education, requesting
for the name of ‘Leong San School’ to be changed to ‘Mee Toh School’ instead.</p>
<p>The ground-breaking ceremony was officiated on 26 May 1954, by Mr Lee
Jun Chen, the then Chairman of the Buddhist Federation.</p>
<p>The name Mee Toh means ‘Eternal Brightness’. A school flag bearing the
prominent Buddhist symbol of the Swastika and the colours of red, white
and green was designed and is raised as Mee Tohians sing the school song
each day to date.</p>
<p>Mee Toh School started off with Chinese as the medium of instruction until
1957 when it became a Government-Aided School. In 1985, the first batch
of Primary Six pupils took the PSLE with English as the first Language.</p>
<p>Today, the school continues the focus on holistic learning and character
development of the children where values are espoused through the motto.
Mee Toh School is determined to continue to provide a conducive environment
for teaching and learning.</p>
