<h4><strong>TIERED SUPPORT SYSTEM@MTS</strong></h4>
<p>In our efforts to develop our students holistically, the Tiered system
of support for students allows the school to reach out to students so that
every student receives quality instruction that matches his / her needs.
Our School Counsellors support students’ mental well-being and social-emotional
development while our SEN Officers support students with learning and behavioural
needs. They work collaboratively with the Case Management Team, school
staff and stakeholders to nurture and build students’ social skills, self-confidence,
self-esteem and sense of independence.&nbsp;</p>
<h4><strong>Student Management Practices</strong></h4>
<p>Discipline is a continuous educational journey aimed at fostering self-discipline
and strong character in our students, grounded in core values and social-emotional
skills. We adopt the philosophy of Discipline with learning, care and dignity
which aims to educate and empower every student to grow and move towards
independence and self-discipline, actions guided by our school’s values.</p>
<p>To achieve this, it is essential to address inappropriate behavior with
consequences that are fair, firm, and timely. Equally important is the
process of restoration, that provides the foundation to build, maintain
and repair relationships amongst students.</p>
<p>The school is committed to guiding all our students to show good character
at all times, even when no one is looking.</p>
