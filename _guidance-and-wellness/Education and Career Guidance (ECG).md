### Education and Career Guidance (ECG)

![](/images/gw4.png)

Education and Career Guidance (ECG) is about equipping students with the necessary knowledge, skills and values to make informed deicions at each key education stage for successful transition from school to further education or work, and hence to manage their career pathways and lifelong learning throughout their lives. (Source: MOE website) The key emphasis for primary school students will be on the development of their self-awareness of their strengths and interests, career awareness and exploration of different educational pathways in Singapore. The ECG component is incorporated in the Form Teacher Guidance Period (FTGP) lessons.

| Level 	| Focus 	| Questions to ponder upon 	|
|:---:	|:---:	|:---:	|
| Primary 1 & 2 	| Exploring Self 	| Who am I? 	|
| Primary 3 & 4 	| Exploring Industries & Occupations 	| Where am I going? 	|
| Primary 5 & 6 	| Exploring Secondary Schools 	| How do I get there? 	|

These lessons and interaction activities are designed to

*   raise students' awareness of their strengths and interests
*   help them plan their educational pathway and select secondary schools.
*   provide more opportunities to explore different careers and nurture their aspirations for the future.

  

Primary 5 and 6 students will also be introduced to the MySkillsFuture portal ([https://www.myskillsfuture.sg/primary](https://www.myskillsfuture.sg/primary)) to embark on a journey of self-discovery and make informed education and career choices. They may use the information and tools to explore various education and career pathways and options, draw the link between school and work, and take charge of their future.

To empower our P5 and 6 students to make a more informed choice pertaining to the selection of secondary schools, our school organises a Secondary School Fest, various Secondary School talks and trips to Secondary Schools’ Open House annually. Last year, together with three teachers, a group of P6 students attended Manjusri Secondary School’s Open House. They participated in interactive programmes such as Fun with Science (Laboratory experiments) and Visual Arts (Drama) which enabled them to experience what they would be learning in secondary school. They also had the chance to visit a number of CCA booths. The students had an engaging and enriching session at the Open House.
