Mee Toh School has achieved the Gold Award in the ezi Go- Green School Competition held by Sembcorp. This is a recognition for our environmental initiatives through our level-wide events like the MTS Green Day, IPW-VIA and Farm-to-Table Programme; recycling right programme through our Recycling Wednesdays and environmental collaterals design competition by our Environment Champions in different languages.  

We have also been awarded the **SembWaste Green Recycling Mark (Gold)** to recognise our active participation in the ezi Recycling Competition. In total, we have collected about 4100 kg of clean and well-sorted recyclables this year.
