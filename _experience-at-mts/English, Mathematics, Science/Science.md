#### HIGHLIGHTS

##### Eco Trails

With the emphasis on inquiry-based learning, green spaces within the school compound have been converted into learning corners for students. The Eco trails are made up of stations that allow students to explore and discover for themselves more about the animals and plants, as well as the environment factors affecting their growth.

##### Primary 3 Hydroponics Programme

The programme aims to engage students in small-scale farming through the growing of organic vegetables. This authentic learning requires the students to plant the seedlings, monitor the growth and harvest the full-grown vegetables. The experience supplements and reinforces the students' understanding of the functions of plant parts.

##### E2K Science

The E2K Science Programme is an enrichment programme to cater to selected Primary 4 and 5 students who demonstrate strong interest and ability in Science. The programme engages students in scientific investigations involving advanced science concepts.

##### Partnering with Our Parents - A Science Workshop for Parents

Science workshops are conducted for parents each year, with the focus to share with parents on how to more effectively engage their children in developing the curiosity and passion in science through

1.        doing and learning science together with the children, <br>
2.      providing the children with more positive science learning experiences by encouraging them to think about and interact with the world around them,<br> 
3.      doing activities which allow the children to use their senses.
