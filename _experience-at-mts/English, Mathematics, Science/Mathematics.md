#### HIGHLIGHTS

**Activity Based Lessons (ABL)**

In Mee Toh School, we design learning experiences to develop students' interest and appreciation for mathematics. Students have fun with mathematics through activity-based learning that engage them in 'learning by doing' and help them to develop conceptual understanding through the Concrete-Pictorial-Abstract approach.

**Mathematical Olympiad Programme**

This enrichment programme is specifically catered for Primary 3 to Primary 6 students who display a strong interest in mathematics. It extends the studentsâ€™ learning by going beyond the primary school syllabus to expose them to higher order thinking skills, concepts and problem-solving strategies.

**Math E2K Programme**

This E2K programme is catered to selected Primary 4 and Primary 5 students who demonstrate strong interest and ability in Mathematics. Stories, games and puzzles are often used within the programme to engage the learners in problem solving.

**Learning Support for Mathematics (LSM) Programme**

The LSM programme is an early intervention programme for Primary 1 and Primary 2 students who need additional support to acquire basic knowledge and skills in numeracy. Lessons are conducted in small-sized groups so that teachers can provide more customized lessons for the students.

**Heuristics Package**

This progressive learning package is designed to equip our students with a wider repertoire of problem-solving and thinking skills that are essential to tackle a variety of problems, including open-ended and real world problems.

**Partnering Parents**

Parents are important partners in the learning of the students. The department shares insights into the learning of mathematics with our parents through school-organised workshops to deepen the understanding of how children learn mathematics.
