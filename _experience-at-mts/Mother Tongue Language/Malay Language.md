#### HIGHLIGHTS

**Baca Ria (Extensive Reading Programmes)**

This programme encourages students to read as many literature resources that encompass variety of genres and topics.

Focused reading can help on building the understanding of reading content and improve language skills, for example expanding students' vocabulary. Speaking and writing skills will be much better if reading habit is instilled in students. Reading will not only add knowledge but sharpen our minds.
