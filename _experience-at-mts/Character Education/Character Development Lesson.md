<h3>Character Development Lesson</h3>
<p>Mee Toh School takes pride in its Character Development (CD) programme,
which features a weekly 30-minute period designed and implemented in partnership
with Tzu Chi Singapore and Tzu Chi's Team of Great Love Mothers.</p>
<p>Since 13 February 2008, this dedicated group of mothers has been volunteering
their time and expertise to guide our students in developing strong moral
character. Their commitment extends beyond the classroom, as they regularly
meet with our teacher-in-charge to discuss strategies for enhancing student
guidance and refining the programme.</p>
<p>This unique collaboration exemplifies our school's commitment to holistic
education, blending academic excellence with character development. We
believe this approach equips our students with the values and skills necessary
to thrive in an ever-changing world.</p>
