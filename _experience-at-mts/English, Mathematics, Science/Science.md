#### HIGHLIGHTS

##### Eco Trails

With the emphasis on inquiry-based learning, green spaces within the school compound have been converted into learning corners for students. The eco trails are made up of stations that allow students to explore and discover more about the animals and plants, as well as the factors in the environment that affect their growth and survival.

##### Primary 3 Hydroponics Programme

The programme aims to engage students in small-scale sustainable farming through the growing of organic vegetables. This authentic learning requires the students to plant the seedlings, monitor the growth and harvest the full-grown vegetables. The experience complements and reinforces the students' understanding of the functions of plant parts.

##### E2K Science

The E2K Science Programme is an enrichment programme to cater to selected Primary 4 and 5 students who demonstrate strong interest and ability in Science. The programme engages students in scientific investigations to discover and deepen their understanding of advanced science concepts through an inquiry approach.

##### Authentic Tasks

For students to develop the ability to generate novel and useful ideas to address issues and solve problems, exercise sound reasoning and use metacognition to make good decisions, authentic tasks are designed for students in Primary 3 to 5 as part of the science curricula. The learning experiences allow students to make connections between scientific concepts and real-world applications as they apply their science knowledge and skills in the tasks.
