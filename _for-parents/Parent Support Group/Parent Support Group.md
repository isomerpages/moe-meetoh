<p>Mee Toh School's parent support group, Parents As Teacher Helpers (PATH),
was formed in 2006. Since then, our PATH has grown from strength to strength
with more than 300 current members. Our PATH members work with the school
to support various programmes and initiatives, such as Active Play, Weekly
Recycling Programme, commemorative events (e.g., Laba Festival, Total Defence
Day), and learning journeys to enhance and deepen the holistic education
of Mee Tohians. PATH members also interact and connect with one another
through parent-child bonding activities or events meant solely for parents'
participation.</p>
<p>It takes a whole village to raise a child. PATH serves as a vital link
between the school and teachers, the parents and the community. As PATH
works closely with teachers and lend their support to school programmes
and initiatives, PATH members have first-hand experience of the school’s
direction, programmes and curriculum that their children undergo in Mee
Toh School. They are thus able to provide valuable feedback on key areas,
such as administration and programmes, to enrich the students' learning
experiences.</p>
<p>PATH's ethos is in line with Aristotle’s belief that, "<em>Educating the mind without educating the heart is no education at all</em>".
Action speaks louder than words, and no textbook can replace the heart,
time and resources that our PATH members have dedicated in service to the
school. PATH members are living and role-modelling our school’s core values
through their acts of contribution to our Mee Tohians. They are an inspiration
to our Mee Tohians, whom we hope they will likewise grow up embracing our
school values and contribute meaningfully to society.</p>
