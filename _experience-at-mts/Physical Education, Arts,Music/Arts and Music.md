<p>To our Mee Tohians, art lessons are fun and enjoyable endeavours as lessons
are not just about developing technical art skills, but enabling them to
express themselves creatively and freely. Our art curriculum runs on a
termly, modular programme based on specific themes. This provides Mee Tohians
with greater art skills experience, deeper exploration, appreciation and
creative expressions through fundamental art forms such as drawing and
painting to sculpture, ceramic and animation works.</p>
