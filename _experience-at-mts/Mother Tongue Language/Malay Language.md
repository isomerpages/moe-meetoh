<h3>Malay Language</h3>
<p>The Malay Language curriculum in Mee Toh School is designed to lay a strong
foundation in learning core language skills as well as develop a love for
the language and culture. Through our integrated and engaging approaches,
we hope our students will grow into self-directed individuals who possess
the qualities of an <em>‘Arif Budiman”</em> – a learned and cultured person
who contributes positively to the society.</p>
<h4>HIGHLIGHTS</h4>
<h5><em>'Baca Ria'</em> (Extensive Reading Programme)</h5>
<p>To instill the love for reading from a young age, our students are exposed
to different reading materials. Supplementary activities are conducted
to reinforce students' understanding of their reading. At the lower primary,
students visit the library weekly to promote good reading habits and library
etiquette. Students also share their current or favourite reads with their
classmates.</p>

<h5>Conversational Chinese and Malay Programme (CCM))</h5>
<p>In Mee Toh School, CCM is offered to Primary 3 students as an enrichment
programme to provide our students with opportunities to learn additional
languages beyond English and their own Mother Tongue Languages. We endeavour
to broaden their perspectives and nurture their joy of learning for languages
and cultures. Students learn simple sentence structure and vocabulary and
take part in conversations on everyday situations using the language. Through
the programme, students gain a deeper understanding and appreciation of
other cultures. They also have opportunities to showcase their learning
through performances during festive celebrations or commemoration of events.</p>

<h5>Mother Tongue Languages Fortnight (MTLF)</h5>
<p>MTLF aims to create an immersive environment for learning and appreciating
Mother Tongue languages and Culture. During this annual event, students
are engaged in fun and meaningful activities to deepen their love and appreciation
of their roots. They experience their respective Mother Tongue Language
as a ‘living language’ through authentic experiences such as learning to
play traditional games, perform <em>wayang kulit </em>and discover <em>songket</em>.
They also have a chance to showcase their oracy skills through intra-level
competitions such as singing folk songs or story-telling.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
