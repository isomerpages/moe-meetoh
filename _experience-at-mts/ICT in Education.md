<p>At Mee Toh School, we believe in empowering our students with the digital
skills they need to thrive in the 21st century. Through our ICT programmes,
our children embark on a journey of discovery, creativity, and collaboration.</p>
<p>Our students begin their ICT journey with fun, interactive programmes.
In Primary 4, students explore the world of coding with Micro:bit, a hands-on
learning tool that introduces them to basic programming and encourages
problem-solving. As they move into Primary 5 and 6, they dive deeper into
coding through Code for Fun, where they build more complex projects while
learning key concepts in computer science.</p>
<p>We also offer AI for Fun, a programme that introduces students to artificial
intelligence in an accessible and engaging way, helping them understand
how AI impacts our daily lives and fostering creativity in tech. In addition,
students from Primary 4 to Primary 6 develop important productivity skills
with Office Productivity Tools, which teach them how to use software like
Word, Excel, and PowerPoint to create documents, presentations, and manage
information. By integrating ICT across subjects, we also enhance learning
in every area from science to the arts. Our ICT programme is designed not
just to teach students how to use technology, but also enables them to
collaborate effectively. Whether they are creating projects, solving challenges,
or learning about digital citizenship, students are empowered to empowered
to become responsible and confident digital users.</p>
