<h4>Goals</h4>
<p>At the end of their primary education in Mee Toh School, all Mee Tohians
will be able to</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>acquire and apply mathematical concepts and skills;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>develop thinking, reasoning, communication, application and metacognitive
skills;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>develop positive attitudes towards Mathematics</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>thus laying a strong foundation in mathematical problem-solving.</p>

<h4>HIGHLIGHTS</h4>
<h5>Activity Based Lessons (ABL)</h5>
<p>Students have fun with Mathematics through activity-based learning that
engage them in 'learning by doing' and help them to develop conceptual
understanding through the Concrete-Pictorial-Abstract approach.</p>
<h5>MTS Maths Week and P1 100th Day of School</h5>
<p>In line with the International Day of Mathematics on 14 March (previously
known as pi day (3.14), we have our very own MTS Maths Week to celebrate
how mathematics has made our world and our lives better. Our P1 students
also celebrate their 100th Day in Mee Toh School in July, which is a key
milestone of their primary school education.</p>
<h5>Mathematical Olympiad Programme</h5>
<p>This programme is specifically catered for Primary 3 to Primary 6 students
who display a strong interest in mathematics. It extends the studentsâ€™
learning by going beyond the primary school syllabus to expose them to
higher order thinking skills, concepts and problem-solving strategies.</p>
<h5>Math E2K Programme</h5>
<p>This programme is catered to selected Primary 4 and Primary 5 students
who demonstrate strong interest and ability in mathematics. Stories, games
and puzzles are often used within the programme to engage the learners
in problem solving.</p>
<h5>Learning Support for Mathematics (LSM) Programme</h5>
<p>This programme is an early intervention programme for Primary 1 and Primary
2 students who need additional support to acquire basic knowledge and skills
in numeracy. Lessons are conducted in small-sized groups so that teachers
can provide more customised lessons for the students.</p>
<h5>Problem-Solving Package</h5>
<p>This progressive learning package is designed to equip our students with
a wider repertoire of problem-solving and thinking skills that are essential
to tackle a variety of problems, including open-ended and real-world problems.</p>
<h5>Partnering Parents</h5>
<p>Parents are important partners in the learning of the students. The department
shares insights into the learning of mathematics with our parents through
school-organised workshops to deepen the understanding of how children
learn mathematics.</p>
