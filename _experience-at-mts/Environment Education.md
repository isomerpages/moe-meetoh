### Environmental Education

Environmental education in Mee Toh School goes beyond textbooks. It encourages outdoor exploration, participate in active weekly recycling, Interdisciplinary Project work and Values-in-Action (IPW-VIA), environmental events and engage in community gardening projects. These activities not only enhance their understanding of environmental stewardship but also promote teamwork and social responsibility. Mee Tohians learn that they can make a difference, whether it is by recycling, conserving water, reducing plastic use and outreach to the community.
