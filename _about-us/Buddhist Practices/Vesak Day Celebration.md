### Vesak Day Celebration

#### 卫塞节庆祝会

卫塞节是佛教徒纪念佛陀出生、成道、涅槃的重要节日。

为纪念每年的卫塞节，弥陀学校会开放给大众前来一起庆祝这别具意义的节日。除了让大众浴佛、供花、供灯烛外，我们也邀请法师们到佛前颂经祈福。

As a school with Buddhist beginnings, Vesak Day celebration is an annual event in Mee Toh School. The venerables from Kong Meng San Phor Kark See Temple are invited to chant the sutras. In addition, the public is invited to participate in the “Bathing of Lord Buddha” ritual which symbolises the determination to purify one’s bad deeds over the good deeds and cleansing of one’s mind. Flowers and fruits are offered to Lord Buddha to remind us of impermanence.
