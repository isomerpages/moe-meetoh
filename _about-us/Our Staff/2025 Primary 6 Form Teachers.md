<br>An educated man is someone who displays culture, taste and knowledge.
So, the true essence of education goes beyond acquiring of knowledge in
an institute. As the saying goes, it takes a village to educate a woman,
educating a child will require collaboration, between home and school for
every child to grow into an educated adult. e child will be able to reach
their fullest potential and bring out the star in them.</p>
