<br>
<br>To equip our children with values and skills to contribute in a fast-changing
globalised world, there is a need to provide a curriculum with learning
opportunities and experiences for them to find meaning in learning. This
will bring about motivation in our children as they take ownership of their
learning and contribute to the society. As motivated children, they will
be able to bring out their best, pursue their passions and fulfill their
aspirations.</p>
