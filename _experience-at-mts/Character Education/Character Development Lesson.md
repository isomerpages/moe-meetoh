**品格发展特别课程-大爱妈妈**

我校是第一所与慈济新加坡分会合作的学校。我校一年级和二年级的学生于2008年2月13日上了大爱妈妈的第一堂课。大爱妈妈们秉持着全面教育的理念，以《静思语》之精髓为引领方针，让低年级的学生在清净良善的环境中培养良好品格。自2013年开始，三年级的学生也有机会参与此计划。大爱妈妈义工与学校紧密合作，配合校训，通过布偶、手语、话剧与小组活动等生动活泼的教学方式，在每周三一节30分钟的课时里，灌输学生正确的价值观，让他们把所学到的体现在日常生活中。

The Character Development (CD) programme in MTS aims to sow the seeds of goodness in the hearts of Mee Tohians and help them develop good moral character. It is planned and carried out in collaboration with Tzu Chi Singapore. Mee Toh was the first school to partner Tzu Chi’s Team of Great Love Mothers. This group of mothers have, since 13 February 2008, volunteered wholeheartedly to guide our students to develop good character. They also meet regularly to discuss ways to better guide the students and fine-tune the programme.

During the weekly 30-minute CD period, the Great Love Mothers carry out specially designed lessons to engage the P1 to P3 students. These lessons are designed to inculcate the teaching of Jing Si Aphorisms as well as to teach moral values.

They are taught using student-centric and creative pedagogies such as puppet shows, skits and sign language songs.
