### Form Teacher Guidance Period (FTGP)

![](/images/gw5.png)

Form Teacher Guidance Period (FTGP) is an integral part of Character and Citizenship Education (CCE) in Mee Toh School. FTGP lessons utilise authentic and meaningful contexts and are differentiated according to the needs of the grade level to ensure age-appropriateness. Interaction activities specially designed to build positive Teacher-Student Relationships (TSR) and class bonding, as well as explicit Social and Emotional Learning (SEL) lessons are conducted to facilitate studentsâ€™ learning and application of Social and Emotional (SE) competencies in the domains of self-awareness, self-management, social awareness, relationship management and responsible decision-making.

  

In MTS, FTGP lessons also include Strategies To Ensure Attention To Individual Pupil Development (SEAIP), Cyber-Wellness (CW), Education And Career Guidance (ECG) and Sexuality Education, which are fundamental in the holistic development of our students.

By supporting the holistic development of every child and designing activities (such as role-playing, games and discussions) to help Mee Tohians recognise their strengths and weaknesses (Self-Awareness); learn ways to manage their emotions (Self-Management); better understand their family, friends and the community (Social Awareness); discover ways to work with others and establish positive relationships (Relationship Management) and make sensible decisions or handle different situations (Responsible Decision Making), they acquire vital life skills and good habits that are required for the 21st century world we live in today, allowing them to create a positive impact in their lives and develop care and concern for others.
