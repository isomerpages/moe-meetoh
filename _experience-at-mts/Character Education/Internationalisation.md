<h3>Internationalisation</h3>
<p>Mee Tohians engage with international students, enhancing their cross-cultural
awareness and communication skills. This interaction broadens their global
perspective and cultural understanding. As they connect with peers from
various backgrounds, the students have the opportunity to serve as ambassadors
of Singapore, participating in a vibrant exchange of ideas.</p>
