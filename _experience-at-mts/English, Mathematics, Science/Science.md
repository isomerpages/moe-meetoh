<h4>Goals</h4>
<p>At the end of their primary education in Mee Toh School, students will
be able to
<br>• use scientific concepts acquired to help them understand themselves
and the world around them
<br>• develop skills, habits of mind and attitudes necessary for scientific
inquiry
<br>• apply scientific concepts and skills in making responsible decisions
<br>• appreciate how science influences people and the environment</p>

<h4>HIGHLIGHTS</h4>
<h5>Eco Trails</h5>
<p>With the emphasis on inquiry-based learning, green spaces within the school
compound have been converted into learning corners for students. The eco
trails are made up of stations that allow students to explore and discover
more about the animals and plants, as well as the factors in the environment
that affect their growth and survival.</p>
<h5>Primary 3 Hydroponics Programme</h5>
<p>The programme aims to engage students in small-scale sustainable farming
through the growing of organic vegetables. This authentic learning requires
the students to plant the seedlings, monitor the growth and harvest the
full-grown vegetables. The experience complements and reinforces the students'
understanding of the functions of plant parts.</p>
<h5>E2K Science</h5>
<p>The E2K Science Programme is an enrichment programme to cater to selected
Primary 4 and 5 students who demonstrate strong interest and ability in
Science. The programme engages students in scientific investigations to
discover and deepen their understanding of advanced science concepts through
an inquiry approach.</p>
<h5>Authentic Tasks</h5>
<p>For students to develop the ability to generate novel and useful ideas
to address issues and solve problems, exercise sound reasoning and use
metacognition to make good decisions, authentic tasks are designed for
students in Primary 3 to 5 as part of the science curricula. The learning
experiences allow students to make connections between scientific concepts
and real-world applications as they apply their science knowledge and skills
in the tasks.</p>
