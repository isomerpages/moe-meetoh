<br>
<br>To equip our children with values and skills to contribute in a fast-changing
globalised world, there is a need to provide a curriculum with learning
opportunities and experiences for them to find meaning in learning. This
will bring about motivation in our children as they take ownership of their
learning and contribute to the society. As motivated children, they will
be able to bring out their best, pursue their passions and fulfill their
aspirations.</p>

<br>
<br>Every child has the inherent desire to learn, do well and do something
meaningful in their lives. Every child is also unique with different interests
and strengths. Children develop and grow at their own pace, towards dreams
of their own making. Hence, our children must be imbued with abundant curiosity
about the world, and a burning desire to innovate for a better future together.
<br>We will nurture these lifelong dispositions in our children. The school
motto of Compassion, Conscience, Purity and Righteousness will be their
guiding compass to lead lives with purpose and meaning.</p>

<br>
<br>Every child is different and unique. It is our job to help them discover
their strengths and limitations so that they can build on the former and
work on the latter. I believe in training the hands, developing the minds
and cultivating the hearts of all our pupils in Mee Toh School. It is our
responsibility to provide and ensure a safe, secure and conducive environment
for our pupils and staff to motivate them to learn and excel and more importantly,
develop a passion for life-long learning. We will never compromise the
well-being of all Mee Tohians.</p>
