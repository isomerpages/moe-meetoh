| # 	| Mdm Hasni Abu Bakar<br>Year Head - Primary 3 & 4<br><br>Children learn best when their social and emotional needs are well taken care of. As educators, we help our children to recognise their strengths and develop good character so that they become confident yet caring individuals. Every child has a gift. Each just opens them at different times. 	|
| # 	| Mrs Leong Seek Eng<br>Year Head - Primary 5 & 6<br><br>'There is more in you than you think.' -Kurt Hahn 	|

| # 	| Mdm Elaine Tan Chew Shie<br>Head of Department - Character and Citizenship Education (CCE)<br><br>'Every child is a seedling.' Developing a child is similar to that of nurturing a plant as consistent planning and care has to be taken to help them grow. Do not underestimate the potential of every child. Together, we can build a more compassionate and cohesive society by raising our next generation to be resilient, appreciative and selfless. 	|
| # 	| Mrs Jacelyn Ang<br>Head of Department - School Staff Developer (SSD)<br><br>An educated man is someone who displays culture, taste and knowledge. So, the true essence of education goes beyond acquiring of knowledge in an institute. As the saying goes, it takes a village to educate a woman, educating a child will require collaboration, between home and school for every child to grow into an educated adult. 	|
| # 	| Mr Chua Meng Joo<br>Head of Department - Information and Communication Technology (ICT)<br><br>"Learning without thought is labor lost; thought without learning is perilous." - Confucius<br><br>All the reasoning, reflecting and deliberating in the world will not bring our thoughts and intention to bear fruit unless they are firmly planted in the soil of knowledge and nourished with the waters of information. 	|

| # 	| Mdm Shanti d/o A Sangaralingam<br>Senior Teacher - English Language<br><br>I believe that each child is unique and has the potential to be better than what he or she is today. I want him or her to experience the joy of learning, discover his or her own strengths, passions and interests and walk through life, enjoying its journey bearing in mind that education is a journey and never a destination. 	|
| # 	| Mrs Redwan (Norlina Bte Ahmadi)<br>Senior Teacher - English Language<br><br>"Give the students something to do, not something to learn; and the doing is of such a nature as to demand thinking; learning naturally results." - John Dewey 	|
| # 	| Ms Neo Li Ting<br>Senior Teacher - Chinese Language<br><br>《论语·为政》——子曰：“学而不思则罔，思而不学则殆”。 一味的读书，而不思考，只会受到书本表象的迷惑而不得甚解。而只是一味的埋头苦思而不进行一定的书本知识的积累，进而对知识进行研究推敲，也只能是流于空想，问题仍然不会得到解决，也就会产生更多的疑惑。只有把学习和思考结合起来，才能学以致用。 	|

| # 	| Ms Lim Ying Lin<br>Senior Teacher - Mathematics<br><br>“Every child deserves a champion - an adult who will never give up on them, who understands the power of connection and insists that they become the best they can possibly be ~ Rita Pierson 	|
| # 	| Ms Dion Ng Hui Lin<br>Level Head - Mathematics<br><br>Education is not all about the learning of facts, but also the training of the mind to think and question. It is important that we do not stop questioning as it allows us to organise our thinking and to develop an inquiry mind. 	|
| # 	| Ms Rachel Yeo Li Choo<br>Level Head - Mathematics<br><br>Education is not just about the teaching of skills and knowledge, it is also about inculcating good moral values and developing every child holistically. I believe that values and attitudes are essential in growing the child. With strong moral values and good attitude, the child will be able to reach their fullest potential and bring out the star in them. 	|
