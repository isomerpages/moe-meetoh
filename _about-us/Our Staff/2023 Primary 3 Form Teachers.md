[**Mr Abdul Faqih Bin Sinuan**](mailto:abdul_faqih_sinuan@moe.edu.sg)<br>**Form Teacher (2) Primary 3-1**<br><br>I believe that each individual has the innate desire to learn, not so much for glory or fame, but to relish this intrinsic joy and euphoric feeling that I can, I will, I tried, tried, tried and succeeded. As a teacher, I want to positively influence my students and help find in them that wonderful feeling and guide them to grow to be great in their own right. |
