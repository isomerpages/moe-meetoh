To our Mee Tohians, art lessons are fun and enjoyable endeavours as lessons are not just about developing technical art skills, but enabling them to express themselves creatively and freely. Our art curriculum runs on a termly, modular programme based on specific themes. This provides Mee Tohians with greater art skills experience, deeper exploration, appreciation and creative expressions through fundamental art forms such as drawing and painting to sculpture, ceramic and animation works.
