<p>Our Physical and Health Education (PHE) department’s vision is to promote
a physically active and healthy lifestyle for everyone through developing
an active body and healthy mind. The regular and purposeful health-enhancing
physical activities and learning tasks foster students’ holistic development
in the psycho motor, cognitive and affective domains. Besides displaying
a positive attitude towards participation in physical activities, students
also learn to cultivate 21st century competencies that can be meaningfully
applied in their daily lives. They explore their interests and acquire
skills and knowledge in achieving and maintaining a lifelong physically
active and healthy lifestyle.</p>
<p>Our vision and mission are guided by the MOE Physical Education Framework:</p>

<h5>Active Play @ Recess</h5>
<p>At Mee Toh School, net-barrier games (badminton and volleyball), field
games (football, captain’s ball and ultimate Frisbee) as well as obstacle
courses (Ninja Warrior and Bouldering) are set up during recess.</p>
<p>This Active Play @ Recess platform encourages students to participate
in the myriad of physical activities of their liking and with their friends.
The platform also helps students to fulfill 150 minutes of moderate to
vigorous intensity physical activities (MVPA) weekly, which is recommended
by the Health Promotion Board.</p>
<h5>Bouldering Module</h5>
<p>A Mee Toh School signature programme, all students get the opportunity
to build their physical skills and mental strength through active participation
in the bouldering learning tasks. Besides the comprehensive and progressive
bouldering module embedded in our PE lessons, students are also able to
boulder as part of the Active Play @ Recess programme. The bouldering module
value adds the PE learning area of Outdoor Education.</p>
<h5>Wushu Quan (Routine) Module</h5>
<p>This module enables students to refine their attentional focus and psycho
motor control in relation to self, as they execute the various Wushu moves
in sequential order and with gusto. Another one of Mee Toh School’s signature
programmes, the module is meaningfully planned for students; their mastery
level progresses each year, which culminates to the final performance routine
at P6.</p>
