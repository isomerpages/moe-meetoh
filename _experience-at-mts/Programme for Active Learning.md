### Programme for Active Learning (PAL)

   
The Programme for Active Learning (PAL) at Mee Toh School offers Primary 1 and 2 students a well-rounded education through diverse, engaging activities that promote Social-Emotional Learning (SEL) and 21st Century Competencies (e21). The programme focuses on holistic development across five key domains: Moral, Cognitive, Physical, Social, and Aesthetic, while fostering important personal qualities such as Care, Integrity, Respect, and Confidence.

PAL provides valuable exposure to two key areas: Sports & Games and Outdoor Education, as well as Performing Arts and Visual Arts. These hands-on, active learning experiences are designed to encourage creativity, promote values, and support social-emotional development, ensuring that students enjoy enriching and meaningful learning.

The programme also aims to help students develop key competencies, including confidence in their abilities, curiosity and a positive attitude toward learning, and strong collaboration skills, ensuring they grow into responsible, well-rounded individuals.
