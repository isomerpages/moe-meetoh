<h3>Character and Citizenship Education (CCE)</h3>
<p>At Mee Toh School, we view character development as akin to nurturing
a seed into a thriving plant. We recognise that each child is unique, requiring
time, patience, and a supportive community to foster their holistic growth
and unlock their full potential.</p>
<p>Character and Citizenship Education (CCE) forms the cornerstone of our
educational philosophy, permeating every aspect of school life—both academic
and non-academic. This approach ensures that CCE is not confined to a single
subject or time slot, but is a continuous process woven into the fabric
of our students' daily experiences.</p>
<p>Our CCE programme is firmly rooted in the core values set forth by the
Ministry of Education, while also being guided by our school's vision,
mission, and motto: Compassion, Conscience, Purity &amp; Righteousness.
These principles serve as a moral compass, steering our students towards
becoming responsible, empathetic, and principled individuals ready to contribute
positively to society.</p>
<p>Through this comprehensive approach, we aim to cultivate not just academically
proficient students, but well-rounded individuals with strong moral foundations
and a deep sense of civic responsibility.</p>
<h4>HIGHLIGHTS</h4>
<h5>Form Teachers’ Guidance Period (FTGP)</h5>
<p>Form Teacher Guidance Period (FTGP) at our school employs authentic contexts
to explicitly teach and reinforce essential social-emotional skills. These
lessons are firmly anchored in values and citizenship dispositions, ensuring
a holistic approach to character development.</p>
<p>During FTGP, we address six key Content Areas of Character and Citizenship
Education (CCE) in a developmentally appropriate manner:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Cyber Wellness</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Education and Career Guidance</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Family Education</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mental Health</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>National Education</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sexuality Education</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>These carefully structured lessons serve a dual purpose: they strengthen
positive Teacher-Student Relationships (TSR) and foster supportive peer
interactions. This approach creates a nurturing environment where students
feel valued and understood.</p>
<p>Importantly, we allocate dedicated time within FTGP for Form Teachers
to engage in individual conversations with students. These one-on-one interactions
provide valuable opportunities for personalised guidance, allowing teachers
to better understand and support each student's unique needs and aspirations.</p>
<p>Through FTGP, we aim to equip our students with the social-emotional competencies
and values necessary for navigating life's challenges and becoming responsible,
empathetic citizens.</p>

<h5>National Education (NE) and Social Studies (SS)</h5>
<p>National Education (NE) is an integral part of our school's citizenship
programme. Through NE, Mee Tohians experience the Singapore story firsthand,
fostering a strong national identity and a spirit of unity.</p>
<p>Our students commemorate four core NE events annually:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Total Defence Day</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>International Friendship Day</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Racial Harmony Day</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>National Day</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>These events, coupled with our Primary Social Studies syllabus, provide
students with opportunities to:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Deepen their understanding of Singapore's history and development</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Explore significant local and global issues</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Develop critical thinking skills</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cultivate values essential for responsible citizenship</p>

<p>Through this comprehensive approach, we aim to nurture Mee Tohians into
informed, empathetic, and active citizens who are ready to contribute positively
to our nation and the world.</p>

<h5>Learning Journeys</h5>
<p>Every year, Mee Tohians embark on diverse learning journeys that extend
education beyond the classroom walls. These excursions offer our students:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Opportunities to acquire knowledge in authentic settings</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A deeper understanding of heritage sites and places of interest</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hands-on experiences that bring textbook content to life</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Insights into becoming well-informed and caring citizens</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Through these immersive experiences, our students gain a richer perspective
on their studies, connecting theoretical knowledge with real-world applications.
These journeys not only enhance their learning but also foster a sense
of curiosity and appreciation for our nation's history and culture.</p>
<p>By engaging with their surroundings, Mee Tohians develop a more holistic
understanding of their education and its relevance to the world around
them, preparing them to be active and responsible members of society.</p>
