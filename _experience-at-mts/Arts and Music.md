<h3>Art and Music</h3>
<h4>Art</h4>
<p>At Mee Toh School, art lessons are not only enjoyable but also enriching
experiences that go beyond simply developing technical skills. They offer
our students the opportunity to express themselves creatively and freely.
Our comprehensive art curriculum is designed around a modular, termly programme.
This approach allows Mee Tohians to gain a well-rounded experience in the
arts, fostering a deeper exploration and appreciation of various creative
forms. From drawing and painting to sculpture, ceramics, and animation,
our students engage with a broad spectrum of artistic disciplines, empowering
them to express their ideas and unleash their full creative potential.</p>

<h4>Music</h4>
<p>Our music curriculum is designed to foster creative expression and communication
through the art of music. In addition to developing musical skills, we
aim to cultivate an appreciation for both local and global musical cultures
in our students. The curriculum offers a range of engaging and enriching
music programmes, each contributing to the holistic development of the
child. By providing diverse musical experiences, we empower students to
explore their musical potential while broadening their understanding of
the worldâ€™s rich musical heritage.</p>
