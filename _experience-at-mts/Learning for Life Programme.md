### Learning for Life Programme (LLP)

SENCE @ MTS (Sports Education Nurturing Character Excellence at Mee Toh School) aims to build knowledge, skills and a positive attitude for a lifetime of healthy living. Through their participation in purposefully-designed activities that are closely aligned with ActiveSG and NurtureSG, students develop healthy lifestyle habits. Other than providing our students with the platform to experience elements of Outdoor Education in a safe environment, we also hope to build their physical and mental strength through their active participation in the bouldering module.
