### Voices of MTS - From students to students

At Mee Toh School, our children’s voices are heard. Not only do we empower our students with 21st Century Competencies to ponder and articulate their recommendations and suggestions, we also give them a platform to let their voices be heard through many different platforms such as, “Mee Toh’s Got Talent”, “3-Tiered Leadership Model” and our very own newsletter written by students for students – “Voices of MTS”, to name a few.
