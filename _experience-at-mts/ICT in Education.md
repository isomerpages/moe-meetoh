#### HIGHLIGHTS

##### Digital Literacy Programme

Our curriculum has been refreshed and embedded with digital literacy skillsets which form essential ICT skills for our students to thrive as 21st century learners in a digital environment. It also includes heightening our students’ awareness of Cyber Wellness to be responsible digital learners.

The Digital Literacy Programme guides our students to be more proficient and confident users of the various software and devices as they progress through the levels over the years. As students build up their competence with these ICT skillsets, they will be able to apply, demonstrate their learning and create their learning artefacts in different creative ways.

**Cyber Wellness (CW)**

Our CW education focuses on building our students as responsible digital learners. There are 3 main principles that guide our students’ decision-making and anchor their well-being:

· Respect for self and others.<br>
· Safe and responsible use.<br>
· Positive peer influence.

Through our CW lessons integrated within our curriculum, our students get to:

·      Sense – Identify possible online risks and protect themselves.<br>
·      Think – Analyse, evaluate and reflect on a situation based on the CW principles<br>
·      Act – Take actions to keep safe and be a positive influence online.

The CW lessons cover the issues associated with ethical, legal, safe and responsible use of ICT in alignment with Character & Citizenship Education (CCE) in MTS. Students get to discuss and reflect on these issues related to being a safe, responsible and respectful user of technology.

**Home-Based Learning (HBL)**

Students participate in yearly Home-Based Learning and e-Learning exercises to develop self-directedness in online learning. This is part of the school Curriculum Continuity Plan which prepares our learners to be ready to continue their learning during prolonged school closure.

Students put into practice the ICT skills they have learnt in school during HBL. Teachers designed lessons on online platforms such as Student Learning Space (SLS) and other online learning platforms. As self-directed learners at home, students completed the assignments virtually. Through the online submissions of assignments, teachers were able to monitor students’ learning. Back in school, teachers continue to provide students with feedback on their performances and support them in reinforcing their learning.
