<h3><strong>Science</strong></h3>
<h5><strong>Eco Trails</strong></h5>
<p>Mother Nature herself is leveraged as the third teacher to nurture our
students into natural inquirers and passionate explorers of the environment
and the world around them. The green spaces within the school compound
include eco trails which are purposefully designed for our students to
discover and appreciate nature around them. Through these authentic experiences,
students are able to make meaningful connections with their science learning.</p>

<h5><strong>Farm to Table Programme</strong></h5>
<p>The programme aims to engage students in small-scale sustainable farming
through the growing of organic vegetables. This authentic learning requires
the students to plant the seedlings, monitor the growth and harvest the
full-grown vegetables. The experience complements and reinforces the students'
understanding of the functions of plant parts.</p>
