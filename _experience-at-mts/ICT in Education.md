<h4>HIGHLIGHTS</h4>
<h5>Digital Literacy Programme</h5>
<p>Our curriculum has been refreshed and embedded with digital literacy skillsets
which form essential ICT skills for our students to thrive as 21st century
learners in a digital environment. It also includes heightening our students’
awareness of Cyber Wellness to be responsible digital learners.</p>
<p>The Digital Literacy Programme guides our students to be more proficient
and confident users of the various software and devices as they progress
through the levels over the years. As students build up their competence
with these ICT skillsets, they will be able to apply, demonstrate their
learning and create their learning artefacts in different creative ways.</p>

<p><strong>Cyber Wellness (CW)</strong>
</p>
<p>Our CW education focuses on building our students as responsible digital
learners. There are 3 main principles that guide our students’ decision-making
and anchor their well-being:</p>
<p>·&nbsp;Respect for self and others.
<br>·&nbsp;Safe and responsible use.
<br>·&nbsp;Positive peer influence.</p>
<p>Through our CW lessons integrated within our curriculum, our students
get to:</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sense – Identify possible online
risks and protect themselves.
<br>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Think – Analyse, evaluate and reflect
on a situation based on the CW principles
<br>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Act – Take actions to keep safe and
be a positive influence online.</p>
<p>The CW lessons cover the issues associated with ethical, legal, safe and
responsible use of ICT in alignment with Character &amp; Citizenship Education
(CCE) in MTS. Students get to discuss and reflect on these issues related
to being a safe, responsible and respectful user of technology.</p>

<p><strong>Home-Based Learning (HBL)</strong>
</p>
<p>Students participate in yearly Home-Based Learning and e-Learning exercises
to develop self-directedness in online learning. This is part of the school
Curriculum Continuity Plan which prepares our learners to be ready to continue
their learning during prolonged school closure.</p>
<p>Students put into practice the ICT skills they have learnt in school during
HBL. Teachers designed lessons on online platforms such as Student Learning
Space (SLS) and other online learning platforms. As self-directed learners
at home, students completed the assignments virtually. Through the online
submissions of assignments, teachers were able to monitor students’ learning.
Back in school, teachers continue to provide students with feedback on
their performances and support them in reinforcing their learning.</p>
