<p>The Malay Language curriculum in Mee Toh School is designed to lay a strong
foundation in learning core language skills as well as develop a love for
the language. Through our integrated and engaging approaches, we hope our
students will grow into self-directed individuals who possess the qualities
of ‘Arif Budiman” – a learned and cultured person who contributes positively
to the society.</p>

<h4>HIGHLIGHTS</h4>
<h5>Mother Tongue Language Fortnight (MTLF)</h5>
<p>MTLF aims to create an immersive environment for learning and appreciating
Mother Tongue languages and Culture. During this annual event, students
are engaged in fun and meaningful activities to deepen their love and appreciation
of their roots. They experience their respective Mother Tongue Language
as a ‘living language’ through activities such as learning to play traditional
games and writing ‘khat’. They also have a chance to showcase their oracy
skills through intra-level competitions.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<h5>'Baca Ria' (Extensive Reading Programme)</h5>
<p>To instill the love for reading from a young age, our students are exposed
to different reading materials. Supplementary activities are conducted
to reinforce students' understanding of their reading. At the lower primary,
students visit the library weekly to promote good reading habits and library
etiquette. Students also share their current or favourite reads with their
classmates.&nbsp;</p>
<h5>Pick and Tell</h5>
<p>Students are taught different components which constitute good public
speaking. During the Pick and Tell session, students present their content
and thoughts based on thematic cards. This activity challenges the students’
thinking to a higher level, enhancing their ability to respond quickly
and raise their confidence in speaking.</p>
<h5>Reader’s Theatre</h5>
<p>To develop reading fluency, students read scripts aloud with expression.
Students do not need to memorise their parts but need only to reread several
times. The repeated collaborative reading increases their comprehension
of the text. Costumes and props are included to enhance their performance.
This strategy increases reading motivation and builds students’ self-confidence.</p>
