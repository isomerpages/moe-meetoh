#### HIGHLIGHTS

**Eco Trails**

With the emphasis on inquiry-based learning, green spaces within the school compound have been converted into learning corners for students. The Eco trails are made up of stations that allow students to explore and discover for themselves more about plants.

**Primary 3 Hydroponics Programme**

The programme aims to engage students in small-scale farming through the growing of organic vegetables. This authentic learning requires the students to plant the seedlings, monitor the growth and harvest the full grown vegetables. The experience supplements and reinforces the students' understanding of the functions of plant parts.
