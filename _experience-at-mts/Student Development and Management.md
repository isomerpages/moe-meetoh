<p>The MTS TIERED STUDENT LEADERSHIP PYRAMID is a progressive model that
allows students to develop their leadership potential based on their strengths
and interests in the 5 spheres of Leadership – SERVICE, CYBER WELLNESS,
HEALTH, ENVIRONMENT AND PEER RELATIONS. Student Leaders are given a VOICE
and EMPOWERED to carry out “BY STUDENTS, FOR STUDENTS” projects to support
their meaningful causes.</p>

<p>In our effort to develop our students holistically, the Tiered system
of support for students allows the school to reach out to students so that
every student receives quality instruction that matches his/her needs.
Our School Counsellors support students’ mental well-being and social-emotional
development while our SEN Officers support students with learning and behavioural
needs. They work collaboratively with teachers to nurture and improve students’
self-confidence, self-esteem and sense of independence.&nbsp; They also
provide individual or small group skills training and intervention. Along
with our Case Management Team, comprising the key members of the Student
Development and Management Committee, the progress of these students is
monitored and the effectiveness of the intervention is evaluated regularly.</p>
