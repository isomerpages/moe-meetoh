### School History Curriculum

There is no present without the past. Our school history curriculum aims to help Mee Tohians develop a deeper appreciation of values through rich stories of our founder and the school’s progression over the years.  It is a progressive curriculum that runs from Primary One to Primary Six.  The curriculum is supported by two different storylines, which run in line with the text in our very own Heritage Centre.

**School Heritage Centre**

**School Heritage Ambassadors**

Selected students are trained as ambassadors to be docents for visitors at the Heritage Centre. Training by the teachers in the School History committee starts at Primary 4. At Primary 5, the students assume senior roles and they help to guide their juniors.
