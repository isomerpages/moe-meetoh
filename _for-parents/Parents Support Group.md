### Parents Support Group (PATH)

After Mee Toh School's parent support group, PATH, was formed in 2006, the team has grown from strength to strength. With 200 members on board currently, parents are keen to come forward to work with the school and support various programmes and initiatives, such as Dharmarathna Festival, Recycling Programme, Clean Your Plate Campaign and learning journeys to enhance and deepen the holistic education of Mee Tohians. PATH members also interact and connect through parent-child bonding activities or events meant solely for parents' participation.

It takes a whole village to raise a child. PATH serves as a vital link between the school and teachers, the parents and the community. Besides working closely with teachers and assisting in projects in the school, members also have the opportunity to experience first-hand the direction the school has embarked on to better understand the school curriculum and to provide valuable feedback on various areas, like administration and programmes, to enrich the students' learning experiences. 

PATH's ethos is in line with Aristotle belief that, "Educating the mind without educating the heart is no education at all". Action speaks louder than words, and no textbook can replicate the heart, time and resources that parents have put into practice the school's core values while volunteering and serving. These are the very same values that we hope every Mee Tohians will grow up embracing.
